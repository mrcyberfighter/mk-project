.. warning::

  Into the right term of the word, criminals are not welcome anyway.

  + They should be told that a computer is a tool not a f@cking machine.

  And that they should stop their shit before it's too late in jail !

  + We work for a better world and not for being annoyed by criminals.

The source are copied into the $(pkgdatadir)/src folder

and a Makefile is provided for hacking the code of mk-project.

---

If you fear that someone change your program

the hash is computed at build time

and copy into $(pkgdatadir) too.

Simply remove the source if you get anxious about this.

Thanks for feedback if you change and/or enhance this tool.

---

:note: $(pkgdatadir) is equal to /usr(/local)/share/prgname.
