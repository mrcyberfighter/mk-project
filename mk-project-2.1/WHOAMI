Hi to user,

I'm a native GNU/Linux geek (Don't forget the GNU) and this file contains

inter alia:

+ The way to write to me a mail (the required headers and footers) :

  if you detect a bug,

  for enhancement ideas,

  for feedback or any comment(s).

+ Read the TODO file: things you can do.

+ Read the HACKME file for hacking the code of mk-project or if you fear criminals. 

+ Read the README file.

===================
Mail subject format
===================

Per example:

[subject:] BUG report about program name.

or

[subject:] QUESTION about program name.

===========
Mail footer
===========

Execute the following script:

  $ chmod +x user_info.sh
  $ ./user_info.sh # Generate a machine check.

And set the generated file named "whoami.info" as attachment or mail footer.

So that I can know better the target system, informations too often not given.

Thanks for feedback, bug-report(s) or any comment(s) !
