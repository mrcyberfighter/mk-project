MacOSX
======

You can make a package for MacOSX because currently only the tar-ball,

as good as it is, is provided for MacOSX.

--------------------
Either a *.pkg file.
--------------------

I though to generate it containing the *.dyn.lib files and library dependencies

and the binaries.

Then to copy the *.dyn.lib to their original location (coming from *brew*)

with a shell script

shipped with the *.pkg file.

Either

The new MacOSX package from what I know nothing.

By twice every tip, knowledges, ideas, and so on...

are welcome. 

In the way of building a package for the lambda user.
